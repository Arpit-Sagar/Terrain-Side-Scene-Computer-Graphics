# Terrain-Side-Scene-Computer-Graphics
An animated simulation of elements presenting a terrain side scene with moving clouds, planes, speed controlled ship and day and night scenario. 

The project aims to show a graphical representation of various user defined functions.
The user is provided with several key controls like:
1. d ->To switch to day scene.
2. n ->To switch to night scene and display stars.
3. v->Erruption of volcano and sound of burst.
4. i-> Stop the moving ship
5. o->Start to move the ship
6. k->Stop the moving plane
7. l->Start the moving plane
Through visualization and simulating the components in a designated fashion, we have tried to
implement the terrain side village scene while exploring the animation effects using OpenGL and
GLUT library functions.
We can switch between day and night scenes , explode the volcano with sound effect and manually
control the start and stop of ship,move the two boats in user defined directions and control their
speed as well, name tagged plane movement and even manipulate the speed of clouds and
windmill.
